Haskell is a purely (see [[Purity]]) functional language. It is defined by the [[Report]]. It was designed by a committee with the following goals:

1.  It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications, including building large systems.
2.  It should be completely described via the publication of a formal syntax and semantics.
3.  It should be freely available. Anyone should be permitted to implement the language and distribute it to whomever they please.
4.  It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.
5.  It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional programming languages.
